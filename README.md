To run the project, clone the repo and run the Makefile :
```shell
  make        # Build the docker images and run the website
  make up     # Activate the website if it's down
  make down   # Deactivate the website if it's up
  make fclean # Destroy the docker images and the persistants datas /!\
  make re     # Destroy & rebuild the docker images and persistants datas /!\
```
Then you should be able to connect to the website on https://"your_ip":6942/ (replace "your_ip" by your actual private ip address)
